Basic Instructions
When provided with multiple options, type the number to the left of the option and press enter to select it.
When presented with a "0" option, it can be used to go back to the previous menu.
All times in the program are based on the 24 hour clock. All time inputs into the program must be formatted in 24 hour
time to work properly.

Initial Run
Provide files named "egt_save.ser", "mgt_save.ser", "rgt_save.ser" and "ugt_save.ser" in the project structure before
running the program, or just run the program and you'll get 4 empty files.
Upon running the program, you first need to create a new account by following the instructions on the screen as logging
in will be impossible.

Messages
Respond to messages by checking your received messages, taking note of the sender's username, and sending a new message
to that person.

Scheduling Speakers
Scheduling a speaker is a different action than creating an event. You must create an event in the program first, then
assign a speaker to an event using a separate command.

Scheduling Events
Events can only be scheduled between 9am and 5pm. Any other times will result in a scheduling conflict message to
appear.

Multiple User Accounts
In this version of the program, an account can only have one role associated with it (i.e. you cannot be an organizer
and a speaker at the same time). However, organizers and speakers have the same functionality as attendees, as well
as additional capabilities.

Logging Out
After logging out, the program will give an option to exit the program by typing "exit", and inputting anything else
will return the user to the login menu.

*** Remember to fully exit and close the program after you are done using it. Do not stop the program while it is still
running, as it will cause issues with saving and information persistence. This sometimes causes the program to throw a
null pointer exception, when used incorrectly. The way to fix this is to clear all the data from the .ser files and
start over. To avoid these problems, always logout and type "exit" when you are finished using the program. ***
