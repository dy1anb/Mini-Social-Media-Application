Basic Instructions
When provided with multiple options, type the number preceding the option and press enter to select it.
When presented with a "0" option, it can be used to go back to the previous session state.

Initial Run
Provide files named "egt_save.ser", "mgt_save.ser", "rgt_save.ser" and "ugt_save.ser" in the project structure before
running the program, or just run the program and you'll get 4 empty files.
Upon running the program, you first need to create a new account by following the instructions on the screen as logging
in will be impossible.

Messages
Respond to messages by first checking received messages and finding who the sender of the message is. Then respond by
sending a new message to the sender.

Logging Out
When logging out, it will give an option to exit the program by typing "exit", and inputting anything else will return
the user to the login menu.

*** In order to ensure that all data is saved correctly, please exit the program properly and do not terminate the
program by force. One of the possible errors is a NullPointerException, and the only way to make the program work again
is to delete all data inside the .ser files that has been serialized. ***
